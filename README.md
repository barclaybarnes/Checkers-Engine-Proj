- Captures are made when a player jumps another player's piece in a diagonal pattern.
- King Conversions are made when a player's piece reaches the other side. King conversion is indicated by an uppercase letter.
- Game Ends when players have either 0 pieces or exceeded 30 moves in the case of stalemate prevention.
